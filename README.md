Martial of Ruby Tuesday Taiwan #16 (2010/01/25) "Learning Ruby with RubyWarrior"

The sample code consists an AI which get all-S Ranks in intermediate epic-mode. I implemented the same logic with 3 different styles: Naive, Pure OO, DSL. You can make a comparison between the 3 implementations: 

* rubywarrior/i-naive: A naive solution(if-else control structure). DON'T LEARN THE BAD CONTROL STRUCTURE!!
* rubywarrior/i-oo: Refactoring with pure OO idioms(Java-style). 
* rubywarrior/i-dsl: Refactoring with Metaprogramming and DSL. 

Some other examples: 
* rubywarrior/dsl-starter: A starter script using my PlayerHelper that can pass beginner lv1. You can try to extend the script to solve other levels. 
* rubywarrior/delegation: Delegation sample code used in slide. (In fact, it's solution of beginner lv5)

Note: You got to pass all levels to enter epic mode. It's strongly suggested to play all levels before reading my solution!
