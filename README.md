Martial of Ruby Tuesday Taiwan #16 (2010/01/25) "Learning Ruby with RubyWarrior"

The sample code consists a logic which get all-S Rank in RubyWarrior intermediate level (couldn't be better). I implemented the same logic with 3 different styles: Naive, Pure OO, DSL. You can make a comparison between the 3 implementations: 

* rubywarrior/i-naive: A naive solution(if-else control structure). DON'T LEARN THE BAD CONTROL STRUCTURE!!
* rubywarrior/i-oo: Refactoring with pure OO idioms(Java-style). 
* rubywarrior/i-dsl: Refactoring with Metaprogramming and DSL.
